      <h1>What Makes Us the Right Choice </h1>
      <p>There are a lot of security companies out there. Unfortunately, many of them do not offer reliable services. At Premier Security Co Ltd, we work hard to earn your trust.  This is done by providing the kind of professional security/ Cleaning service that you demand.  Here are just a few of the things that have set us apart from our competitors.</p>

      <h3>1. We Answer the Phone always</h2>
      <p>There is one promise you can count on when you use Premier Security Co Ltd Services: you can talk to a live security supervisor at any time – day or night.  Call most security companies after 5 PM and you get a voicemail. </p>
      <h3>2. We have a Professional Office</h2>
      <p>At Premier Security Co Ltd, we have several professional offices at different branches to ensure we are providing a quality product to our clients.</p>
      <h3>3. Our Security officers are well Trained</h2>
      <p>Training is the difference in our men and women behind the badge.  Our approach to training is based on the individual needs of the clients and the officers’ need for meaningful ongoing professional development.Premier security provides ongoing professional development to keep skills sharp through clear training paths.  To maintain training standards, we keep a record of completed training. </p>
      <h3>4. Our Guards stay Awake while on duty</h2>
      <p>The last thing you want is a tired security guard who has gone from night shift to day shift.  At Premier, our night shift guards only work nights and day guards’ only work during the day.</p>
